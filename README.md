# PokemonSystem

This project is a Pokemon System API designed to handle various operations related to Pokemon species, trainers, and images. The API is built with a microservices architecture, consisting of four main services:

1.  **Gateway**: Acts as the entry point for all API requests and routes them to the appropriate services.
2.  **external_api**: Fetches data and images from an external Pok√©mon API.
3.  **pokemon_img_server**: Manages Pokemon images, storing and retrieving them from MongoDB.
4.  **pokemon_server**: Handles core features using MySQL, such as adding Pokemon species, managing trainers, and evolving Pokemon.
5.  Redis Cache: Provides caching for frequently accessed data to improve performance and reduce load on the database.
